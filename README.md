# SmartContract-Auction-Store-

When bids come to your mind, you will surely know that if you pay more, you win.

Therefore, with the capabilities that the blockchain provides me with and learning the
basics of the Solidity programming language, I developed a smart contract that simulates
the principle of the auction system on the remix work environment.

This Smart Contract provides many services within the constraints that you have designed.
1- Create an account.
2- Create a product.
3- An auction on the product.
4- Return all products.
5- Return user information.
6- Return all users.
